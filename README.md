## About This Site

These presentations are built with [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and deployed via GitHub Pages. All slides are written in markdown with custom themes for consistent, professional styling.

**Interested in the setup?** The codebase demonstrates a workflow for creating beautiful presentations from markdown, complete with custom themes, grid systems, and reusable components. While this repository contains my personal content and isn't licensed for reuse, I'm happy to help you set up something similar. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:john.iv@x25bd.com) if you'd like to discuss the approach or spin out the tooling as a standalone project.

**Technical details:**
- Markdown-first authoring
- Custom themes (minimalist research style, dark Astral theme)
- Comprehensive grid system for layouts
- Live reload development server
- Static export for hosting

The presentations live at the root of this repository. Examples and documentation are available in the source.
